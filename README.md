# QGIS processing plugins developed at ICRA

This repository contains all QGIS processing plugins developed at ICRA.

Below are listed and briefly explained the algorithms included:

### buildings2sewer
'buildings2sewer' connects the buildings of a city to the manholes of the sewer system. It connects each building (using the centroid as a departure point) to the closest manhole that is in the same or in a lower altitude.

### fixTheNetwork
'fixTheNetwork' fixes the topology of a network to ensure that wastewater flows correctly from each manhole in the network to the WWTP.
