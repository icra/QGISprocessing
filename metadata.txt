about=buildings2sewer connects the buildings of a city to their nearest lower manhole (or any other geometries). It incorporates two parameters that work together: maximum distance and altitude tolerance. If a connection is larger than maximum distance, the manholes 1 metres higher than the building are also considered. This iteration is repeated until "altitude tolerance" is reached.
