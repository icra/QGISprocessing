<h3>buildings2sewer</h3>

<p>
'buildings2sewer' is a QGIS processing plugin that connects the buildings of a city to the manholes of the sewer system. It connects each building (using the centroid as a departure point) to the closest manhole that is in the same or in a lower altitude.
</p>

<p>
It returns the centroids of the buildings with the following fields:
<ul>
  <li>Id of the manhole which the building is connected</li>
  <li>Altitude of the building's centroid</li>
  <li>Distance between the building's centroid and the connected manhole</li>
  <li>Altitude difference between the building's centroid and the connected manhole</li>
</ul>
If "Createconnection lines is checked", it also returns a layer withe the lines showing each connection.
</p>

<p>
Two parameters can be adjusted:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Maximum distance:</b> If a connection is larger than the maximum distance, the algorithm searches manholes 1 meter above. This iteration is repeated until the connection is shorter than the maximum distance or until the altitude tolerance is reached </li>
  <li> <b>Altitude tolerance:</b> It determines how many meters upper a manhole can be regarding the building to connect. The altitude tolerance is only used when the maximum distance is surpassed</li>
</ul>
